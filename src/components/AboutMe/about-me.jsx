        <p>
          I have a dual B.A. in Economics and Philosophy. My favorite class was
          Modal Logic. Currently I'm a Sr. Program Manager for an airline
          seating company. I'm a self-taught rhythm guitarist and avid board
          gamer. I occasionally sing a tone deaf tune to my roommate's cat,
          Gabby. I became interested in coding a few years ago finished free
          courses on Code Academy for Python and SQL. Now I'm looking to expand
          on that interest towards a more fulfilling career. I'd like to someday
          own my own business or develop some passive income streams.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm currently enrolled in a Uconn Coding Boot Camp to learn the
          foundational knowledge needed to pursue my career and personal
          interests.
